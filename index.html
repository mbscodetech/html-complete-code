<pre>
    England's totals in this Test. That was a commendable effort by the Indian bowlers 
    
    in both the innings. Their batters set the tone with a massive first innings total, 
    
    while the bowlers completed the formalities with a clinical performance against a 
    
    strong team like England. India Women take on Australia Women in the upcoming week, 
    
    and they'll be riding high on confidence after such an emphatic performance. 
    
    Australia are a much stronger side though, hence you can expect that one-off Test 
    
    to be much more competitive than this one. Do join us for the live coverage of that 
    
    match. For now, it's a goodbye from Nikhil, Sagar and Harish. You can switch tabs 
    
    and follow our coverage of other ongoing matches..
