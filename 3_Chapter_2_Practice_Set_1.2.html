<h1>WHAT IS NATURE?</h1>
<p><pre> <b>Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide 
    us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water 
    we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for 
    numerous other goods and services we depend on for
     our health, happiness and prosperity.</b></pre></p>

   <h2>WHY IS NATURE SO IMPORTANT FOR HUMANS</h2>
    <p><pre>On a personal level, nature gives me a sense of
        peace and wellbeing. An escape from the rat race 
        and a calming influence on the soul. I never cease 
        to be amazed at what nature has to offer. @stevelilart
        We are nature, nature is us. @Shr0pshirelassy
        Nature is us, it's everything around us & without 
        it we're nothing at all. The natural world is why I
         get up in the morning & why I live the way I do, as 
         a vegan with a garden full of flowers who loves our
          poor planet. @elliebus
        We are nature, we are animals. If we overstep our 
        boundaries, nature will put us back in our place, 
        despite our best efforts to overcome that @BlackburnTidy
        Its life. Without it, we dont exist. @AlexandracfPB
        Utterly absorbing & definitely therapeutic. People in 
        my local park that visit each day to feed the ducks say 
        it keeps them sane. @CondelynneLynne
        For me, I think nature is healing for mental health 
        conditions and trauma. Also, blue and green spaces, 
        and sounds of nature are evidenced to impact positively
         on mood and well-being. Even a 5 minute walk makes a
          difference to health. Which I am off to do nowâ€¦ @jlhallwriter
        Everything we have, the "stuff" comes from nature, manufactured,
         from our natural resources. The health and availability of 
         all that we eat comes from nature. The clean water and air is
          dependent on nature. The Natural environment is our only life support. @ShannBeverley
        Nature is... That is All @CavendishLucy
        On a bad day it's wonderful to go for a walk and escape from it all @HCM421
        Because Nature is the truth! Humans can be false! @mamachildie
        So the human beings can reflect on: Why are human beings 
        so important to Nature? @2troie
        Imagine waking up every day on the moon, a colourless barren
         landscape. With nature comes colour, life and a multitude of 
         exhilarating experiences some may only see once in a lifetime. @pilts1974
        Without nature we wouldn't live, but of course that doesn't seem to
         register with some folks, they are intent in destroying the nature we have @guyofwarwick1
        Nature is happiness in a very elemental way. @CateMS111
